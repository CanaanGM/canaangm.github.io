# what's *ssh*?

>SSH stands for **Secure Shell**. It is a secure network protocol that allows secure **communication** and **remote access** between two devices.

## Gen a key

> Both win and Unix share the same generation method.

```bash
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t  ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/<NAME> -C <E-MAIL>
```

## deamon status

- make sure the *deamon* is running:
  - linux: `sudo systemctl status sshd` start it by replacing **status** w/ **start**
        - auto-start it: `sudo systemctl enable sshd`
    - termux: `sshd` will **start** the deamon, `pkill sshd` will **kill** it.
    - win : install it via: `Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0`
      - if it fails `class not registered` or smth similar , check [this](https://www.saotn.org/manually-install-openssh-in-windows-server/) 
  - start it via: `start-service sshd`, `get-service sshd` will check the status.
    - auto-start it: `Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'`

## copy the key to remote machine

### **windows** *to* linux

```powershell
type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\<KEY> | ssh -p <PORT> <USER>@<HOST> "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"
```

### example *to* **termux**

```powershell
type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\tablet.pub | ssh -p 8022 u0_a380@192.168.1.15 "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"
```

### **linux** to linux

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/<KEY> <USER>@<HOST>
```

### **linux** to windows

> we're kinda screwed here; u'd need to copy the key manually:

- add the contents of the `.pub` into `$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\authorized_keys`
  - if it's not there, create it.

### to **Github**

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
# add the key to the agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/NAME
# copy the PUBLIC key
clip < ~/.ssh/NAME.pub # NO CLIP ? nano it !
```

> if you're using **termux** and you quit the session, you'd have to re-add the keys, so maybe add them to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` at th end.

then got to `https://github.com/settings/keys`, create a new key and paste what u've copied there.



## test the generated key

> if you're trying to connect to a **windows** machine and u still got prompted for a pass, chances are the user is an admin.

simply add the contents of the `authorized_keys` into `adminstartors_authorized_keys` located in `C:\ProgramData\ssh`

```bash
ssh <USER>@<HOST> -i <THE KEY>
```

ex:

```bash
ssh canaan@192.168.77.130 -i ~/.ssh/luna
```

## Securing the connection

- files that needs to be edited:
  - Linux: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
  - Win: `C:\ProgramData\ssh\sshd_config`

### disable password auth

> after you've generated your keys and made sure to test them.

open the file depeding on your system and:
![ssh-password-auth](/assets/images/ssh/password_auth.png)

uncomment it by removing `#` and change it to **no**

restart the service `sudo service ssh restart`

### Change the port to a less common one:

in the same file, uncomment the `port` and change it's value, then restart the service

connect like this after : `ssh -p <port>`


### Set a time interval for the connection

- in the system specific file uncomment/add:
  - ClientAliveInterval < Interval>
  - ClientAliveCountMax 0 <- max connections
